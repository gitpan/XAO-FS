NAME
    XAO::DO::FS::List - List class for XAO::FS

SYNOPSIS
     my $customers_list=$odb->fetch('/Customers');

     my $customer=$customers_list->get('cust0001');

DESCRIPTION
    List object usually used as is without overwriting it. The XAO class
    name for the list object is FS::List.

    A list object provides methods for managing a list of FS::Hash objects
    of the same class -- storing, retrieving and searching on them.

    List class shares most of the API with the Hash class.

    Here is the list of all List methods (alphabetically):

    check_name ()
        Object names in lists have nearly the same set of restrains as in
        hashes with just one exception - they can start from a digit. Such
        behavior might be extended to hashes in later versions to eliminate
        this difference.

        For example, 123ABC456 is a legal Hash id inside of a List, but is
        not a legal property ID or List ID inside of a Hash.

    container_key ()
        Returns key that refers to the current List in the upper level Hash.

    container_object ()
        Returns a reference to the hash that contains current list.

        Example:

         my $customer=$orders_list->container_object();

        Do not abuse this method, it involves a lot of overhead and can slow
        your application down if abused.

    delete ($)
        Deletes object from the list - first calls destroy on the object to
        recursively delete its content and then drops it from the list.

    describe ()
        Describes itself, returns a hash reference with at least the
        following elements:

         type       => 'list'
         class      => class name of Hashes stored inside
         key        => key name

    detach ()
        Detaches current object from the database. Not implemented, but safe
        to use in read-only situations.

    exists ($)
        Checks if an object with the given name exists in the list and
        returns boolean value.

    get (@)
        Retrieves a Hash object from the List using the given name.

        As a convenience you can pass more then one object name to the get()
        method to retrieve multiple Hash references at once.

        If an object does not exist an error will be thrown.

    get_new ()
        Convenience method that returns new empty detached object of the
        type, that list can store.

    glue ()
        Returns the Glue object which was used to retrieve the current
        object from.

    key_length
        Returns key length for the given list. Default is 30.

    keys ()
        Returns unsorted list of all keys for all objects stored in that
        list.

    new (%)
        You cannot use this method directly. Use some equivalent of the
        following code to get List reference:

         $hash->add_placeholder(name => 'Orders',
                                type => 'list',
                                class => 'Data::Order',
                                key => 'order_id');

        ....

         my $orders_list=$hash->get('Orders');

    objtype ()
        For all List objects always return a string 'List'.

    put ($;$)
        The only difference between list object's put() and data object's
        put() is that key argument is not required. Unique key would be
        generated and returned from the method if only one argument is
        given.

        Key is guaranteed to consist of up to 20 alphanumeric characters.
        Key would uniquely identify stored object in the current list scope,
        it does not have to be unique among all objects of that class.

        Value have to be a reference to an object of the same class as was
        defined when that list object was created.

        Example of adding new object into list:

         my $customer=XAO::Objects->new(objname => 'Data::Customer');
         my $id=$custlist->put($customer);

        Attempt to put already attached data object into an attached list
        under the same key name is meaningless and would do nothing.

        Note: An object stored by calling put() method is not modified and
        remains in detached state if it was detached. If an object already
        existed in the list under the same ID - its content would be totally
        replaced by new object's content. It is safe to call put() to store
        attached object under new name - the object would be cloned. In
        order to retrieve new stored object from database you will have to
        call get().

    search (@)
        Returns a reference to the list of IDs of objects corresponding to
        the given criteria.

        Takes a perl array or perl array reference of the following format:

         [ [ 'first_name', 'ws', 'a'], 'or', [ 'age', 'gt', 20 ] ]

        All innermost conditions consist of exactly three elements -- first
        is an object property name, second is a comparison operator and
        third is some arbitrary value to compare field with or array
        reference.

        As a convenience if right hand side value refers to an array in
        condition then the meaning of that block is to compare given field
        using given operator with all listed values and join results using
        OR logical operator. These two examples are completely equal and
        would be translated to the same database query:

         my $r=$list->search('name', 'wq', [ 'big', 'ugly' ]);

         my $r=$list->search([ 'name', 'wq', 'big' ], 
                             'or',
                             [ 'name', 'wq', 'ugly' ]);

        It is possible to search on properties of some objects related to
        the objects in the list. Let's say you have a list with
        specification values inside of a product. To search for products
        having specific value in their specification you would then do:

         my $r=$list->search(['Specification/name', 'eq', 'Width'],
                             'and',
                             ['Specification/value', 'eq', '123']);

        You are not limited to object down the tree, you can search on
        object up the tree as well. Obviously this is mostly useful for
        collection objects because otherwise there is a single object on top
        and search turns into boolean yes/no ordeal.

        Example:

         my $r=$invoices->search([ '/Customers/name', 'cs', 'John' ],
                                 'and',
                                 [ '../gross_premium', 'lt', 1000 ]);

        Sometimes it might be necessary to check is a pair of objects inside
        of some container have specific properties. This can be achieved
        with instance specificators:

         my $r=$products->search([ [ 'Spec/1/name', 'eq', 'Width' ],
                                   'and',
                                   [ 'Spec/1/value', 'eq', '123' ],
                                 ],
                                 'and',
                                 [ [ 'Spec/2/name', 'eq', 'Height' ],
                                   'and',
                                   [ 'Spec/2/value', 'eq', '345' ],
                                 ]);

        Numbers 1 and 2 here suggest that first name/value pair must be
        checked on the same object, while the second - on another. Numbers
        do not have any meaning by themselves - 1 and 2 can be substituted
        with 234 and 345 without changing effect in any way. Some very
        complex criteria can be expressed this way and in most cases
        execution by the underlying database layer will be quite optimal as
        no postprocessing is usually required.

        Another example is to use asterisk which means "assume a new
        instance every time". This can be useful if we want to find an
        object which container contains a couple of objects each satisfying
        some simple criteria. For instance, to find an imaginary person
        profile that has both sound and image attached:

         my $r=$profiles->search([ 'Files/*/mime_type', 'sw', 'image/' ],
                                 'and',
                                 [ 'Files/*/mime_type', 'sw', 'audio/' ]);

        In theory bizarre cases like this should work as well, although no
        good example of real life usage comes to mind:

         my $r=$list->search([ '../../A/1/B/2/C/name', 'cs', 't1' ],
                             'and',
                             [ '/X/A/2/B/1/C/desc', 'eq', 't2' ]);

        See also 'index' option below for a way to suggest a most effective
        index.

        This can be extended as deep as you want. See also collection()
        method on Glue and XAO::DO::FS::Collection for additional search
        capabilities.

        Multiple blocks may be combined into complex expressions using
        logical operators.

        Comparison operators:

        cs  True if the field contains given string. There are no
            limitations as to what could be in the string. Having dictionary
            on the field will not speed up search.

        eq  True if equal.

        ge  True if greater or equal.

        gt  True if greater.

        le  True if less or equal.

        lt  True if less.

        ne  True if not equal.

        sw  True if property starts with the given string. For example
            ['name', 'sw', 'mar'] will match 'Marie Ann', but will not match
            'Ann Marie'.

            In most databases (MySQL included) this type of search is
            optimized using indexes if they are available. Consider making
            the field indexable if you plan to perform this type of search
            frequently.

        wq  True if property contains the given word completely. For example
            ['name', 'wq', 'ann'] would match 'Ann Peters' and 'Marie Ann',
            but would not match 'Annette'.

            For best performance please make this kind of search only on
            fields of type 'words' -- in that case the search is performed
            by dictionary and is very fast.

        ws  True if property contains a word that starts with the given
            text. For example ['name', 'ws', 'an'] would match 'Andrew' and
            'Marie Ann', but 'Joann' would not match.

            Works best on fields of type 'words'.

        Logical operators:

        and - true if both are true (has an alias -- '&&')
        or - true if either one is true (has an alias -- '||')

        Examples:

         ##
         # Search for persons in the given age bracket
         #
         my $list=$persons->search([ 'age', 'ge', 25 ],
                                   'and',
                                   [ 'age', 'le', 35 ]);

         ##
         # A little more complex search.
         #
         my $list=$persons->search([ 'name', 'ws', 'john' ],
                                   'and',
                                   [ [ 'balance', 'ge', 10000 ],
                                     'or',
                                     [ 'rating', 'ge', 2.5 ]
                                   ]);

        The search() method can also accept additional options that can
        alter results. Supported options are:

        orderby
            To sort results using any field in either ascending or
            descending order. Example:

             my $list=$persons->search('age', 'gt', 60, {
                                           'orderby' => [
                                               ascend => 'first_name',
                                               descend => 'second_name',
                                           ]
                                      });

            Note, that you pass an array reference, not a hash reference to
            preserve the order of arguments.

            If you want to order using just one field it is safe to pass
            that field name without wrapping it into array reference
            (sorting will be performed in ascending order then):

             my $list=$persons->search('age', 'gt', 60, {
                                           'orderby' => 'first_name'
                                      });

            Caveats: There is no way to alter sorting tables that would be
            used by the database. It is generally safe to assume that
            english letters and digits would be sorted in the expected way.
            But there is no guarantee of that.

            Remember that even though you sort results on the content of a
            field it is not that field that would be returned to you, you
            will still get a list of object IDs unless you also use 'result'
            option.

        distinct
            To only get the rows that have unique values in the given field.
            Example:

             my $color_ids=$products->search('category_id', 'eq', 123, {
                                                'distinct' => 'color'
                                            }); 

        debug
            Turns on debug messages in the underlying driver. Messages will
            be printed to standard error stream and their content depends on
            the specific driver. Usually that would be a fully prepared SQL
            query just before sending it to the SQL engine.

        index
            Accepts one argument -- a field name (or a path to a field) that
            should be used as an index. Normally you do not need to use this
            option as in most cases underlying driver/database will make a
            right decision automatically. This might make sense together
            with 'debug' option and manual checking of specific queries
            performance.

            Example which might make sense if you know for sure that
            restriction by image will significantly reduce number of hits,
            while ages range leaves too many matches open for checks.

             my $r=$list->search([ [ 'age', 'gt', 10 ],
                                   'and',
                                   [ 'age', 'lt', 60 ],
                                 ],
                                 'and',
                                 [ 'Files/mime_type', 'sw', 'image/' ],
                                 { index => 'Files/mime_type' });

        limit
            Indicates that you are only interested in some limited number of
            results allowing database to return just as many and therefor
            optimize the query or data transfer.

            Remember, that you can still get more results then you ask for
            if underlying database does not support this feature.

             my $subset=$persons->search('eye_color','eq','brown', {
                                             'limit' => 100
                                        });

        result
            Note: [Not completely implemented yet]

            Be default search() method returns a reference to an array of
            object keys. Result options allows you to alter that behavior.

            Generally you can pass single description of return value or
            multiple descriptions as an array reference. In the first case
            what you get then is array of scalars, in the second case -- you
            get an array of arrays of scalars.

            Description of return value can be a scalar -- in that case it
            is simply a name of field in the database; or it can be a hash
            reference. For hash reference the only required field is 'type',
            that determines type of the result. Other parameters in the hash
            depend on the specific type.

            Recognized types are:

            count
                No other parameters, return number of would-be results for
                the search. Resulting array will have only one row if
                'count' is used.

            key Returns object ID, just the same as would be returned by
                default.

            sum Returns arithmetic sum of all 'name' fields in the resulting
                set.

            Examples:

             my $rr=$data->search('last_name','cs','smit', {
                                orderby => 'last_name',
                                result => [qw(id last_name first_name age)]
                            });

             my $rr=$data->search({
                                result => {
                                    type    => 'count',
                                },
                             });
             my $count=$rr->[0];

             my $rr=$data->search({
                                result => [ {
                                    type    => 'count',
                                }, {
                                    type    => 'sum',
                                    name    => 'gross_rev',
                                }
                            ] });
             my ($count,$sum)=@{$rr->[0]};

        Beware that these options usually significantly decrease search
        performance. Only use them when you would do sorting or select
        unique rows in your code anyway.

        As a degraded case of search it is safe to pass nothing or just
        options to select everything in the given list. Examples:

         ##
         # These two lines are roughly equivalent. Note that you get an array
         # reference in the first line and an array itself in the second.
         #
         my $keys=$products->search();

         my @keys=$products->keys();

         ##
         # This is the way to get all the keys ordered by price.
         #
         my $keys=$products->search({ orderby => 'price' });

    values ()
        Returns a list of all Hash objects in the list.

        Note: the order of values is the same as the order of keys returned
        by keys() method. At least until you modify the object directly on
        indirectly. It is not recommended to use values() method for the
        reason of pure predictability.

    uri ($)
        Returns complete URI to either the object itself (if no argument is
        given) or to a property with the given name.

        That URI can then be used to retrieve a property or object using
        $odb->fetch($uri). Be aware, that fetch() is relatively slow method
        and should not be abused.

         my $uri=$customer->uri;
         print "URI of that customer is: $uri\n";
